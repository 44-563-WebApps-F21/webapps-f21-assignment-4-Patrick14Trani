    <h3>Act 1: Algernon Moncreiff's Flat in Half Moon Street</h3>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially
        invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in
        Heaven—<span class="stage-direction">[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once
        interferes.]</span> Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are
        ordered specially for Aunt Augusta. <span class="stage-direction">[Takes one and eats it.]</span>
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        Well, you have been eating them all the time.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. <span class="stage-direction">[Takes plate from
        below.]</span> Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for
        Gwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        <span class="stage-direction">[Advancing to table and helping himself.]</span> And very good bread and
        butter it is too.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it
        all. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not
        married to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        Why on earth do you say that?
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.
        Girls don’t think it right.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        Oh, that is nonsense!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        It isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number
        of bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I
        don’t give my consent.
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        Your consent!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">ALGERNON</h5>
    <p class="algernon speech">
        My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to
        marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.
        <span class="stage-direction">[Rings bell.]</span>
    </p>

    <h5 class="name">JACK</h5>
    <p class="jack speech">
        Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I
        don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.
    </p>

        Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the
        last time he dined here.
